# Context

## About the Measurement Coalition
The Coalitionâ€™s charter is to make digital advertising exposure data from the Open Internet available so that advertisers can properly and transparently measure the effectiveness of campaigns and ensure engagement with consumers is relevant and valuable. The Coalition is open to any media company that adheres to its standards and its commitment to enabling transparent and open measurement.

## General Principles
- **Human Readable** - Prefer semantic names and identifiers that can be interpreted without system-specific knowledge. For example, `Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto` versus `65`.
- **Commonality** - The type information contained within standardized measurement logs needs to be shared across participants. Therefore, maintaining only useful fields and being purposeful about additions is crucial to the success of a unified format.
- **Privacy** - User privacy is core to a successful and sustainable coalition. Care must be taken to preserve user privacy and comply with applicable regulation.
- **Openness** - As much as possible, decisions about the measurement coalition should be made in the open, with feedback from participants, advertisers and the broader ecosystem.

# File Format
## File Naming Convention and Packaging

Measurement log files are provided in a tab-separated, gzipped format. The files are broken up into 500 megabyte chunks, if necessary. If the file is chunked, the parts will be numbered with an integer.

Values of the variables in the filename may contain letters, integers and ASCII special characters (except for underscores, periods and whitespace).
